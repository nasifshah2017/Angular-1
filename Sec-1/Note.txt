Please Note on sequence of Lectures


As Angular uses TypeScript language to build the code,  In the Next Section- I have explained
TypeScript Object oriented Programming Basics.

If you are new to typescript, I recommend you to watch this Section 2 to understand how to
define Classes, Interfaces, Keywords, functions ,Typing, objects, operators in Typescript.  This
Section 2 is exclusively on TypeScript and nothing to do with Angular.



If you are already aware of basics, then feel free to Skip Section 2 and Start  directly with Angular
from Section 3.
